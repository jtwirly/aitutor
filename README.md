# AI Tutor
PyTorch-based Coding Learning AI Project

AITutor is an AI-based system designed to facilitate coding learning for beginners. The system utilizes machine learning and natural language processing techniques to provide personalized feedback to students as they practice coding problems.

## Features
- Built a dataframe of coding problems and solutions using open-source coding repositories and datasets
- Trained a machine learning model to identify coding problems and provide personalized feedback
- Utilized natural language processing to improve the system's understanding of student inputs
- Conducted testing and evaluation to ensure the system's effectiveness and accuracy

## Requirements
- Python 3
- PyTorch
- Flask
- HTML/CSS/JavaScript
- Kaggle datasets: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/stackoverflow/pythonquestions

## Installation
1. Download the Kaggle datasets
2. Clone the repository: git clone https://github.com/username/AITutor.git
3. Install the required packages: pip install -r requirements.txt

## Usage
1. Run the program in your terminal or via Flask server: python aitutor3.py
2. Ask questions in the section where you see a question about Python and receive an answer in your terminal, or open a web browser and go to http://localhost:5000/
3. Enter a coding problem
4. Receive personalized feedback from the AI system
